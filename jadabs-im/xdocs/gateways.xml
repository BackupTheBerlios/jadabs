    	<p>
		We needed 2 different gateways. One to transform a instant message into an email or a sms, and one to 
		transform a JXME message into a SIP message.
		</p>
  	</section>
  	
  	<section name="JXME/SIP Gateway">
  		<p>
  			From the JXME world, an instant messenger can communicate with a SIP messenger through a gateway. 
  			Of course the JXME messenger must first register to the proxy (by sending a REGISTER message).
  		</p>
  		
  		<subsection name="Unsolved issues">
  			<p>
  				The authentication from the JXME side to a SIP proxy is a difficult task, because the gateway 
  				is in-between. We cannot make sure that the message forwarded by the gateway is the message we sent.
  				The gateway must be authenticated and trusted.

		<p>
			This code is specific to ETHZ network infrastructure. You'd have to rewrite it partially to make it work outside of the ETHZ VPN. 
		</p>
  	</section>
  	
  	<section name="Implementation">
  		<p>
  			The gateways use the SIP stack from the SIP handler package <code>ch.ethz.jadabs.sip.handler</code>
  			and they share a common interface Gateway in <code>ch.ethz.jadabs.gw.api</code>.
