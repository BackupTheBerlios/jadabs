		The Jadabs IM project was developed at the Swiss 
		Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich as part of the
		Distributed Systems Laboratory.

	<p>
		The deployed architecture provides a combined SIP and JXME infrastructure for instant messenging. We enhanced the infrastructure with
		the possibility of sending "offline" instant messages via email and SMS. The project includes a SIP proxy, JXME/SIP/SMTP gateways, a registration and authentication infrastructure.
		We also provide a messenger application, which works on small devices such as iPaqs and modern cellular phones (MIDP 2.0 cell phones).
