		<p>
			We wanted to implement an instant messaging application which runs on several devices, from a laptop to a mobile phone, using a SIP infrastructure and a distributed JXME infrastructure.
			Our infrastructure is able to deliver an instant message even when a user is offline. It detects the presence of a user and in case the user is offline, it
			forwards the message either as an email or an sms, depending on the user's preferences. We also had to find a way to merge a distributed 
			JXME infrastructure with our SIP infrastructure, using a SIP/JXME gateway, which transforms messages from one protocol to another.
		</p>

		<p>
			In order to use the instant messenger in the SIP infrastructure, a user must register itself to the infrastructure, via a <a href="webapp.html">web application</a>.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Our infrastructure needs following components:
			<ul>
				<li>A web application, for the users to register, and set their preferences</li>
				<li>A SIP Proxy, for the SIP messaging, and message forwarding</li>
				<li>A SIP/SMTP gateway, to send SIP messages as email and/or SMS</li>
				<li>A SIP/JXME gateway, to send messages from a JXME messenger to our SIP infrastructure</li>
				<li>A messenger, which can use either JXME or SIP, and which can run on small devices</li>
			</ul>
			Here is how all this works together.
