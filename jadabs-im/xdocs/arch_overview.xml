		The users register themselves via the web application in a database, which is accessible by the SIP proxy and the SIP/SMTP gateway.
		The proxy needs it to know whether a user has the right to register and use the services provided by the proxy.
		The SIP/SMTP gateway needs access to the database to check whether the user wants his messages send to his email address, 
		to sms, or both.

			In that figure you can see how a message is delivered to a user.
			<ol>
				<li>Alice tries to reach Bob, if he's online, the message is directly send to his instant messenger application.</li>
				<li>Proxy answers.</li>
				<li>If Bob is not currently online, the message is sent to the SMTP/SIP gateway.</li>
				<li>The gateway checks whether the user wants an email or an sms or both.</li>
				<li>It is transformed in an SMTP message and sent either to the SWITCH SMS gateway or directly to the email server.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

			At the beginning, we wanted to implement it in a way where the proxy is just a discovery proxy. It means that when Alice wants to send
			a message to Bob, she asks the proxy where to find Bob and receives back the IP address of Bob (or of the SMTP gateway of Bob is offline).
			Then, Alice sends the message herself to Bob. But finally, we implemented it as a centralized proxy, which transmits everything itself
			to the receiver.
