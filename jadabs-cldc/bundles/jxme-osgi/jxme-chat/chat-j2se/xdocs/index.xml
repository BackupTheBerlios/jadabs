   <a href="../jxme-chat/index.html">JXME-BT-Chat MIDlet</a> which 
    is a demo application (test application) for the JXME-BT
   transport layer that has been developed during the semester work. 
   This component is a chat client with that uses <code>jxme-bt</code> compiled for J2SE. The 
   application offers a Swing GUI that provides the necessary
   functionality for the chat operation.  </p>             
   
	<p>Except for the GUI differences this application is identical 
      with the <a href="../jxme-chat/index.html">JXME-BT-Chat</a> MIDlet.

      the <a href="../jxme-chat/index.html">documentation of the
