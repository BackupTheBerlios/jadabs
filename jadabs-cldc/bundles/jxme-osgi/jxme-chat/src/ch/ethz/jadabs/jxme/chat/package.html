 	Chat MIDlet that uses Jadabs JXME-J2ME Messaging and Bluetooth Transport.
   
   This package contains a Chat MIDlet that uses JXME-J2ME messaging
   and the JXME-BT transport for Bluetooth communication between the 
   chat peers. It is a demo application for the newly implemented 
   BT Layer for Jadabs-JXME. 
   
   The application was developed based on <a href="http://www.benhui.net/modules.php?name=Bluetooth&page=bluechat">Ben Hui's BlueChat
   Application</a>. In the JXME-Chat the communication part from Ben's BlueChat
   was replaced by JXME-BT messaging. Additionally Log4J-J2ME was used for 
   proper debug output.
