 	A test MIDlet application for the JSR 82 API.
   
   This package contains a MIDlet application that allows some 
   basic testing of the <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=82">JSR-82</a> API. 
   It can be used to test the implementation of JSR 82 in real devices. It makes 
   use of the OSGi-J2ME container and the Log4J-J2ME bundle but neither of JXME
   nor JXME-BT as it accesses the raw JSR 82 API.
