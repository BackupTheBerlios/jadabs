   The <a href="http://www.benhui.net/modules.php?name=Bluetooth&page=bluechat">BlueChat
   MIDlet</a> does neither use any Jadabs nor any JXME/JXTA
   feature. The source code has not been altered except some minor modifications 
   in the package name, that allowed a seamless integration into the Java maven 
   tree. This allows automatic creation of the executable binary using the 
   Antenna-Maven-Plugin.
