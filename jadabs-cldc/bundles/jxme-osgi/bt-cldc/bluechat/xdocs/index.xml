    <section name="Ben Hui's BlueChat MIDlet">
      <p>The 
      <a href="http://www.benhui.net/modules.php?name=Bluetooth&amp;page=bluechat">BlueChat
   MIDlet from Ben Hui</a> was used as a reference model and starting point in the 
   development of the Jadabs Bluetooth Transport Layer. The BlueChat application was 
   integrated into the Jadabs-CLDC source for educational purpose. The BlueChat MIDlet
   can easily be build using the 
   <a href="http://wlab.ethz.ch/plugins/maven-antenna/">Maven-Antenna-Plugin</a>. </p>
   
   <p>Apart from some package renaming Ben Hui's code was not altered. Therfore 
      the BlueChat application from the Jadabs-CLDC does not use Jadabs, JXME or 
      the JXME-Bluetooth-Layer; it is self consistent. </p>
      
   <p>The downloadable JAR and JAD files can be created from the <code>bluechat</code>
      directory as follows using the Maven default goal:</p>
      
<source>$ cd bt-cldc
$ cd bluechat
$ maven</source>      

	<p>This creates two files <code>bluechat.jad</code> (the Java Application Descriptor)
      and the <code>bluechat.jar</code> (the Java Archive).</p>
