 	Smart Messenger MIDlet application that uses the SMS-Gateway component to send short messages.
   
   This package contains an Smart Messenger MIDlet application makes use of the 
   <a href="../../../../../../smsgateway/index.html">SMS-Gateway Service</a>.
   It provides a simple GUI where the user can enter the phone number the 
   short message is to be sent to and the message text itself.
   
   Because the SMS-Gateway service is used the short message is sent over the
   cheapest communication channel available, either over the SMTP-SMS-Gateway 
   if an SMTP-Gateway service is available or over the GSM network (i.e. Wireless
   Messaging API) of no SMTP-Gateway is available. This all happens transparently 
   to the user. The Smart Messenger application is in fact not <i>smart</i>
   since all logic is implemented in the SMS-Gateway component.
