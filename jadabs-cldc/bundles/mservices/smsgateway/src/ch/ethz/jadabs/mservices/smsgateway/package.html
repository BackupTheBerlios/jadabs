 	SMS Gateway that provides a location depended interface for sending short messages.

   
   This package contains an SMS Gateway whose functionality is to provided an
   interface to send short message to another mobile phone. This service is location
   depended, i.e. depending on the location/environment the short message can 
   be sent over SMTP to an SMTP-SMS-Gateway (which might even be 
   free of cost). An SMTP Gatway (see Jadabs main tree) can be used to send emails is automatically 
   discovered using discovery messages sent over JXME. If no SMTP Gateway is available,
   the  SMS-Gateway uses the the <a href="../../../../../../../smsservice/index.html">SMS-Service</a> which sends the short message over 
   the Java <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/wma/"></a>Wireless Messaging API (WMA)</a>
   which is not free of cost (here in Switzerland it is even rather expensive). 
   
   This service is an example for a location independent component for mobile devices.
