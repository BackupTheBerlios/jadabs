	Lightwight implementation of the OSGi Framework API for J2ME/CLDC devices.
   
   This package contains a very primitive, that is to say lightwight implementation
   of the basic functionality required by an OSGi container. Note that this 
   implementation does comply to the full 
   <a href="http://www.osgi.org/osgi_technology/download_specs.asp?section=2#Release_3">OSGi 
   specification (revision 1.1)</a>. Only the very basic functionality needed for
   Jadabs on J2ME/CLDC was implemented. There are no different class-loaders, reflection
   and so forth. The service registry is realised as a simple hash table.
