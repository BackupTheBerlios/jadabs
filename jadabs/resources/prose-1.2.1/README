!!! SUMMARY

This is a binary release of PROSE (PROgrammable extenSions of sErvices)
See also: http//prose.ethz.ch/

!! QUICK START

'bin/jprose' is a program that activates PROSE in the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) your are using.  It calls Java and then runs YOUR
program with java. It accepts a superset of the Java arguments.
For example,

    'jprose -claspath <mycpath> MyClass'

is equivalent to

    'java -classpath <mycpath> MyClass'

If you run you Java programs with 'jprose' instead of 'java', you will
be able to dynamically weave and unweave prose aspects to/from your Java
applications.

Note that 'jprose' is NOT a modified JVM: it weaves aspects using the
*standard* interfaces of the JVM. Note also that 'jprose' is not a
simple replacement of 'java'. It provides java applications with the
ablity to be extended at run-time.

!! COMPILING applications for prose

Prose allows you to (i) write aspects as pure Java classes and (ii) weave
these aspects at run-time through an application. To learn how to write
prose aspects, please consult

http://prose.ethz.ch

When you compile such Java (aspect) classes, add the following jars to your
classpath

	'lib/prose/lib/jdk-prose-loc.jar'
	'lib/prose/lib/jdk-jvmai-loc.jar'


!! EXAMPLES

in the directory 'docs/examples/basic' you find an example of
how to compile and run a basic logging example with PROSE.

Also, the files under <prose>/pseudo-jre is __not__ a real JRE. It is a
directory with the same structure as a JRE, but using a real JRE from
a different location.



IN PARTICULAR, THE 'prose/pseudo-jre/bin/java' SCRIPT IS NOT THE TRUE
JAVA EXECUTABLE OF A JRE. IT IS A SCRIPT THAT INDIRECTLY CALLS 'java'
AND ALLOWS ANY JAVA PROGRAM TO BE ENHANCED WITH RUN-TIME ASPECTS.
THE 'java' SCRIPT IN THIS DIRECTORY CORRESPONDS TO 'jprose'. THIS
SCRIPT IS NAMED 'java' FOR CONVENIENCE ONLY. IT INDIRECTLY CALLS THE
ACTUAL JAVA EXECUTABLE AND ADDS SIGNIFICANT FUNCTIONALITY TO JAVA,
BY ALLOWING RUN-TIME WEAVING USING THE DEBUGGER INTERFACE (JVMDI).
THE LOCATION OF THE USED JAVA(TM) 2 RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT SOFTWARE,
COMPLETE AND UNMODIFIED, CAN BE FOUND IN THE FILE '<prose>/pseudo-jre/README.PSEUDOJRE-LOG'
