 	The event system package contains the API for a basic 
 	Event System interface. The IEventService is the main
 	service of the event system. To use this service a reference
 	can be looked up through the BundleContext by querying 
 	with IEventService.class.getName().
 	</p>
 	<p>
 	To <b>publish</b> an event use the IEventService.publish(event).
 	Be sure the event type is also on the other node or no
 	filter will match.
 	</p>
 	<p>
 	To <b>subscribe</b> for an event, create first an instance of
 	the interested event, specify the attributes and from this the filter.
 	</p>
 	<p><i>
 	StringEvent event = new StringEvent();
 	Filter filter = new FilterImpl(event);
 	
 	eventsvc.subscribe(filter, listener);
 	</p></i>
