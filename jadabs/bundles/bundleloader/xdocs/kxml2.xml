    <p>
	<code>BundleLoader</code> expects bundles to be described in obr files, that are 
	xml encoded. For parsing these (and other xml based descriptors), <code>kxml2</code>
	by kobjects.org is used. <code>kxml2</code> is a lightweight implementation of the 
	xmlpull specification. 
	So instead of building up large data structures for a DOM tree, xmlpull 
	sweeps through the document and processes only the current element. But in difference 
	to SAX, where handlers are registered that are called on specific events 
	(SAX is a push system), xmlpull leaves it up to the application to extract 
	the required information of the current element or continue processing with the 
	next element. This is less flexible than DOM or SAX but very efficient in terms 
	of resources and specially designed for small devices like PDAs or mobile phones. 	
	<code>BundleLoader</code> uses <code>kxml2</code> to parse the descriptor 
	files. While obr files encode the information in elements to comply with the Oscar Bundle
	Repository format, opd files use attributes to specify Plugins. This is more efficient
	because all attributes of an element can be read and processed at once while encoding by
	elements mean that the parser has to process more than one line and might have to wait until 
	all required elements have been parsed.
