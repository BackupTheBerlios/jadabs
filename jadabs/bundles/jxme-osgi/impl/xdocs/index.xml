    	<subsection name="Overview">
    	<p>
    		For the communication layer we use a peer to peer concept as
    		proposed in <a href="http://www.jxta.org">JXTA</a>. Due to its
    		large footprint JXTA cannot be run on small devices like a PDA
    		or a mobile phone. A proposed smaller implemenation by the JXTA
    		community is known as <a href="http://jxme.jxta.org">JXME</a>.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		With this JXME-OSGi package we have taken over code and ideas by
    		the JXME project and revised it to use it in a container
    		like OSGi. Furthermore, the original code has been devided into
    		a core package and a service API and service Impl package. The
    		hardcoded network layer has been disassembled and supports now
    		different pluggable network implementation.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Currently JXME-OSGi nor JXME is fully message compatible with
    		a JXTA node. A proxy or gateway is still needed which connects
    		the JXME communities with the JXTA community.
