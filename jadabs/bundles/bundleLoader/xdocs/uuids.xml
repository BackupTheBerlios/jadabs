 Jadabs Bundle Loader resolves the dependencies between bundles. The 
 bundle that is to be loaded is defined by it's uuid (universal unique
 identifyer) that can easily derived from the bundle's properties:
 <source>
     bundle-group + ":" + bundle-name + ":" + bundle-version + ":" + idtype
 </source>
 So the uuid for the bundle "jxme-osgi-0.7.1" is 
 <code>jadabs:jxme-osgi:0.7.1:jar</code>
 while the uuid for the corresponding obr file is 
 <code>jadabs:jxme-osgi:0.7.1:obr</code>. Compliant to the maven  
 repository format, it is expected that the location of the bundle in a 
 repository is <code>repopath/group-name/jars/</code> and the obr is in
 <code>repopath/group-name/obrs</code>.
