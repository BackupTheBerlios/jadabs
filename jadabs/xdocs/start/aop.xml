    <section name="Jadabs - AOP">
	<p>
		A core feature of Jadabs is its integrated AOP capabilities.
		We look at AOP in two different ways. First, as a static
		way of extending software components with new functionality.
		Second, as a behavior change at runtime which would otherwise
		lead to a restart of a running component.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the <a href="download.html">download</a> page different
		AOP configurations are supported.
		Following we discuss how we support the two AOP types static and
		dynamic.
	</p>	
		<subsection name="static AOP">
		<p>
			The Jadabs core has been built by using AspectJ itself. The
			core platform consists therefore of the AspectJ runtime library 
			per default.
		</p>
		</subsection>
 
 		<subsection name="dynamic AOP">
 		<p>
			As a basic dynamic AOP concept Nanning is supported. As Nanning
			runs on J2ME-CDC VMs it is included per default.
		</p>
		<p>
			For nodes with VMs running on the normal VM the dynamic AOP approach
			from Prose can be included.
