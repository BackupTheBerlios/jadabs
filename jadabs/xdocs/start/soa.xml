    <p>
    	Abbreviated SOA, it is an application architecture locally or in a 
    	distributed infrastructure. An application is nowedays built up
    	of many components which can be plugged together at compilation
    	or runtime. Services are special components which are self-contained
    	and maintain its own state. They provide their functionality as a
    	well defined interface to other services or components.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Whereas SOA concept is characterized into local and remote architecture
    	the same principles can be applied.
    </p>
   	<p>
		Though built on similar principles, SOA is not the same as Web services, 
		which indicates a collection of technologies, such as SOAP and XML. SOA 
		is more than a set of technologies and runs independent of any specific 
		technologies. Web services is regarded as an implementation of SOA.

 	<p>
 	A service in SOA is an exposed piece of functionality with three properties:
	<ol>
		<li>A service contains a well defined interface whereof the service
		can be used by other services or components.</li>
   		<li>A service can be dynamically located and invoked.</li>
   		<li>A service is self-contained. That is, the service maintains its own state.</li>
 	</ol>
