		<p>
			Jadabs offers the possibility to download and install software bundles at runtime.
			In a distributed environment with such possibilities, it might be of importance to
			give some guarantees:
			<ul>
				<li>Is the supplier of the software the one she or he claims to be?</li>
				<li>Is the integrity of the dowonloaded bundle given?</li>
				<li>Does the software actually do what it is supposed to do, i.e. is it not malitious?</li>
			</ul>
			The security enhancements of Jadabs can fulfill the first two requirements.	The
			third requirement might be hard to satisfy. But with the provided enhancements,
			it can be guaranteed that the software is provided by the given entity.
