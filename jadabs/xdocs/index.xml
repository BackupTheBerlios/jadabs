		<p>
			Jadabs is a dynamic lightweight container for small devices in a 
			distributed environment. Many distributed infrastructures exists
			so fare like Jini, Jxta, Messaging Systems, etc. All of them
			lack so fare the possibility to be run on small devices. 
		</p>
		<p>
		    With Jadabs a two layered approach is taken. The first layer
		    is a dynamic lightweight container using <a href="http://www.osgi.org">
		    OSGi</a> and <a href="start/aop.html">dynamic AOP</a>.
		    The second layer consists of bundles which can be loaded, 
		    activated, stopped, and removed again. A core distributed framework is
		    provided which follows the core JXTA specifications. The distributed
		    framework uses part of JXME.
		</p>
	    <p>
		    The scenario shown below represents a typical mobile infrastructure.
		    With Jadabs and <a href="http://jadabs.berlios.de/jadabs-cldc">Jadabs-CLDC</a> 
		    we can provide a middleware for such distributed mobile infrastructures.
