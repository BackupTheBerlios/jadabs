      <p>
        We list here packages and other projects which have been bundled for 
        OSGi. In most cases we only had to extend the MANIFEST-INF with
        the OSGi Bundle-MetaInformation like Bundle-Export and Bundle-Import.
        In some cases we also added an Activator to start the bundle, i.g., Log4j.
