        For setting up the mobile device, process the following steps:
        Go to the provider of your mobile device and possibly install
        a firmware for it. The mobile device should be JSR82 conform, to
        support bluetooth communication. Dependent on the model, you have
        to invest more or less effort on that (see instructions of the provider
        of your mobile device).
