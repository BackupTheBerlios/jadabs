        As the name implies, the Jadabs WebServices project integrates web services into Jadabs. 
        It was developed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The first part of the project offers a general web service infrastructure.
        Implementing a powerful new web service is facilitated by a collection of well documented interfaces, classes and protocols.
        Three device classes are supported: A mobile device for the user (e.g. a cellular phone), a server that offers the service and
        a proxy for the connection between the mobile device and the server.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The second part of the project is an example web service based on the infrastructure mentioned above.
        This web service gives the user the possibility to query the SBB (Swiss Federal Railway) timetable server.
        The query is sent from a mobile device via Bluetooth and forwarded to a server by a proxy.
        This server queries the SBB server, processes the results and sends them to the mobile device, again via the proxy.
